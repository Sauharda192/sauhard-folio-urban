## Manasa

*Manasa* is a Nepali programming language originally intended for children. 

I made this logo(also intended as an icon) and chose a kite as the emblem for our project. The Nepali word "मनसा" means imagination. The kite symbolizes aspirations and imaginations.

The color blue was used to represent the skies and also to make the viewer feel warm and welcomed.
